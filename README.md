# Stock Price Prediction using Financial News



In a financially volatile market such as the stock market, it is necessary to have a precise prediction 
of future price trends. 
Investing in stock market carries risk, but if approached in a disciplined manner secure prediction of 
the values of the stocks can be made. 
Making such predictions requires the implementation of advanced algorithms of machine learning. 
This project contains implementation of  different machine learning algorithms such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
and GRU (Gated Recurrant Unit). 
The experimental results show an accuracy of 54.4% when implemented using GRUs 
and an accuracy of 51.43% when implemented using LSTMs.
